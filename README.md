# Bearing-Only-SLAM - 1849977
Repository for the Probabilistic Robotics' final project

To launch the code open the octave-cli inside the folder 2D_Bearing_Only_SLAM and type "BEARINGONLYSLAM". The results will be plotted at the end together with the chi error evolution.

NOTE
The final results (robot poses and landmark positions) present a slight rotation w.r.t. the ground truth.
